But just before I was about to break under the crushing pressure, the highlighters presented themselves to me. This ingenious invention allowed me to sieve through the pile of notes for the crucial information. With its vibrant colours, it gave me light when I was in the dark. The highlighter lit up the path, and guided me through my educational journey. To me, the different vivid colours of the highlighters symbolise the diversity of us Hwachongians, our motto of \"4 Facs, 1 Hwach\". Yellow Kexin for Athena. Green Dylan for Athena. Blue luke for Artemis. Purple Rayna for... well... anyways... all in all, the highlighters proved to be an indispensable aspect of my life, giving me, and you, every reason to vote for them this election. \ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\ude4c"], "ducknighter": ["one time i almost drowned luke kissed and revived me"], "alexandra.yhm": ["Jiayous @blue_luke.tham checked up on me whenever I was down a super caring person!!"], "stinqrae": ["luke isn\u2019t funny\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05"], "halfway_line": ["If you dont vote luke, your making a mistake"], "tomyumbanmianbrainrot": ["One time I was feeling hungry in school and my super idol @blue_luke.tham instantly made a phone call and bought the entire McDonalds franchise.
