His best friend was a firefly that glowed in the dark just like alaric's heart will for you if you vote for him. the firefly came from afar, but chose to move in with the dragon. such is the power of friendship! just like how alaric and daniel will be friends for you. i digress. anyway, the dragon guarded the castle with all its heart, just like alaric will guard the school for you! i digress. anyway, on one fateful night the dragon was protecting its castle. it is lonely sometimes, even with the firefly. sometimes, the dragon would go to the nearby village to buy some food in the stubborn society. however, the dragon only has 50 dollar notes, and because the society is stubborn, they don't like getting change. i digress. \"how i wish for a friend who can guide me through my hard times! how lonely i am in this castle.\" suddenly, a shooting star zoomed past. \"quickly, make a wish!\" cried the firefly. closing his eyes, the dragon made a wish. opening his eyes, he anticipated his wish coming true. and he waited. but nothing came. nothing. it was back to the same old darkness, the same old gloom and loneliness. sadly, the dragon retreated into his abode. just then, out of the blue, 4 burrito wraps popped up. they were the legendary alaric, daniel, xuan en and huiwen. legend says that around them, for every 60 seconds in their presence, 1 minute passes. \"hello\", they said. \"we are here to make your lives better!\" with a swing of their tortillas, they turned the gloomy castle into a beautiful house, filled with joy and laughter! they brought people to the dragon, as he made friends and learned to enjoy life. and for the firefly, they gave her a lamp. even if she faced difficulty, she would not be alone. it is through this story, told from generation to generation, that they have become myths, legends even, that many aspire to become. vote for breakfast wraps! >.<"

As expected of a physics god, she had managed to make the stone conserve 100% of its energy whenever it skipped and thus today it is still somewhere out in the ocean skipping. However her insane abilities had disrupted the plans of the russians as the ripples that her skipping stone made prevented their ships from advancing towards snake island and this caused the russians to approach us that fateful day with 30 warships. HOWEVER BEING THE TITAN THAT SHE IS upon seeing the warships she immediately turned into BEAST MODE and picked up a giant boulder, crushed it and threw it at the warships, sinking all of them. Julia saved ging mie\u2019s and my life that day, and she also taught us how to skip stones, and she also made us bio lovers love physics. therefore, in conclusion, to sum it all up, vote for julia \ud83d\ude00"

Beyond that, there was also a phone above the sink, playing a hour long video of hentai. Was this the pathetic task I was delegated to accomplish? Why is the toilet bowl filled with voluminous amounts of damp tissue paper? Thoughts were racing through my mind, until I recalled that the last person to enter the toilet was my fellow teammate, BENNETT! \n\nImmediately, I knew that Bennett was up to no good and has been taking part in highly suspicious activities all this while. \"He must be the killer!\", I mused. To my horror, Bennett walked right into the toilet at the same time and took responsibility for the mess in the toilet! Oh no! Was this my end! Is this how I was destined to die?\n\nWorried sick, I kneeled down and begged for mercy, pleading for him not to take my life. Unexpectedly, not only did Bennett spare my life, but he also taught me numerous tricks on how to win at Amogus! Bennett's patience and teachings helped me improve my game by leaps and bounds, and as such, I am forever in his debt. VOTE BENNETT FOR COUNCIL!"

But just before I was about to break under the crushing pressure, the highlighters presented themselves to me. This ingenious invention allowed me to sieve through the pile of notes for the crucial information. With its vibrant colours, it gave me light when I was in the dark. The highlighter lit up the path, and guided me through my educational journey. To me, the different vivid colours of the highlighters symbolise the diversity of us Hwachongians, our motto of \"4 Facs, 1 Hwach\". Yellow Kexin for Athena. Green Dylan for Athena. Blue luke for Artemis. Purple Rayna for... well... anyways... all in all, the highlighters proved to be an indispensable aspect of my life, giving me, and you, every reason to vote for them this election. \ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\ude4c"

However, given the immense difficulty of the task, I almost didn\u2019t sign up for it, until @leggooo.yenyee told me 5 seconds before the deadline, \u201cLEGGOO! You won\u2019t regret this!\u201d \ud83d\ude4cThese 5 words were all I needed and my confidence skyrocketed. Alas, the bike ride was challenging and I encountered a monster fish \ud83d\udc20 while transporting my bike across the sea\ud83c\udf0a. In a futile attempt to defend myself, I was almost eaten alive by it, but suddenly a Brazilian Jiujitsu kick\ud83e\uddb5\ud83c\udfff went straight for the monster fish. In my last moments of consciousness, Yen Yee finished the monster off and snapped her first aid kit out of thin air to save me\u26d1, before I fainted there and then out of relief.\nTo all Hwachongians, missing someone who has your back like Yen Yee does for me? Fortunately and unsurprisingly, Yen Yee will go to similar extents with her mastery of BJJ and first aid certification to support all of you. What more convincing do you need?

He used his GENIUS intellect to come up with such an GAVINtense game (to lose all your money \ud83d\udcb5 ) and his legacy really carries on till today. Other notable achievements of Gavin include: being the first man to dunk a basketball \ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31, started the trend for males to have long hair, coming up with the renegade dance, reaching Uranus in one night, and housing all sorts of exotic birds and creatures in the nest on his head, helping to preserve the future generations of near extinct animals. Till now, Gavin has been making beneficial contributions to the continuation of humanity. I remember one day I was starving during lessons and almost about to lose hope, when a small prawn dumpling fell from the sky. I was so starving and about to eat it, but the beast Gavin descended from the heavens and smacked the minuscule dumpling away and replaced it with a PIPING HOT and JUICY Char SIUUUUUUUUUUU Bao. Now, this has filled me for 2 months and I nvr have to worry about being hungry ever again. If you want HCI to become the most technologically advanced, culturally diversified, and animally unique paradise, please give your vote to @csb.ogavin_6.6 for the best school life possible!!!! 10/10 CHARishing, 10/10 model SIUdent and 10/10 capaBAO!!!"
