However, this night was different as we were playing a real game of amogus, with life or death consequences.\n\nAs I headed to the toilet of my mansion to complete my task, I was horrified to take notice of the severely clogged toilet bowl. Beyond that, there was also a phone above the sink, playing a hour long video of hentai. Was this the pathetic task I was delegated to accomplish? Why is the toilet bowl filled with voluminous amounts of damp tissue paper? Thoughts were racing through my mind, until I recalled that the last person to enter the toilet was my fellow teammate, BENNETT! \n\nImmediately, I knew that Bennett was up to no good and has been taking part in highly suspicious activities all this while. \"He must be the killer!\", I mused. To my horror, Bennett walked right into the toilet at the same time and took responsibility for the mess in the toilet! Oh no! Was this my end! Is this how I was destined to die?\n\nWorried sick, I kneeled down and begged for mercy, pleading for him not to take my life. Unexpectedly, not only did Bennett spare my life, but he also taught me numerous tricks on how to win at Amogus!
